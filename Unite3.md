# Unit 3 Collegeboard-Notes
# Boolean expressions and if statements

3.1 Boolean Expressions: So, Boolean expressions? They're like questions that can be answered with either a "yes" or a "no" in programming.

3.2 if Statements and Control Flow: 'if' statements? They're like traffic signs that direct the flow of your code based on conditions.

3.3 if-else Statements: 'if-else' is like a fork in the road - you choose one path if something's true, and another if it's not.

3.4 else if Statements: 'else if' statements? It's like having a bunch of choices in a menu, but you only pick the first one that's available.

3.5 Compound Boolean Expressions: Compound boolean expressions? They're like combining puzzle pieces using 'and', 'or', and 'not' to make a big decision.

3.6 Equivalent Boolean Expressions: Equivalent boolean expressions? They're different ways of asking the same question, but you'll always get the same answer.

3.7 Comparing Objects: When you compare objects, you're checking if they're like twins or just look similar - it's not about what they're made of, but if they're the same.
