# Collegeboard-Unit4 Notes
 
4.1 while Loops: "While loops in programming allow a block of code to be executed repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true."

4.2 for Loops: "For loops provide a concise way to iterate over a range of values, making tasks like list processing or counting more efficient."

4.3 Developing Algorithms Using Strings: "This section focuses on creating algorithms that manipulate and process strings, which are sequences of characters."

4.4 Nested Iteration: "Nested iteration involves using one loop inside another, enabling complex patterns or multi-dimensional data processing."

4.5 Informal Code Analysis: "Informal code analysis emphasizes evaluating code for readability, modularity, and overall effectiveness, rather than formal verification."
