Unit 2 Collegeboard  notes: 

A class is a blueprint for creating objects with the same behavior and defined attributes

An objects is specific centity , made from a class, you can manipÄ±late in your program 

Objects are instances of classes with variables used to name them

Each object has behaviors and attributes that are defined by the class that was used to create it

We can have more than 1 contructor for an object. This is called overloading the constructor

Methods define the behaviors for all objects of a class and consist of a set of instructions for executing the behavior
